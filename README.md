# GuitarEffectsPedal

Electric guitars have been around since the 1930s and have become a staple in modern music. Back then, guitars sounded quite weak and didn't pack much punch, so musicians began creating ways of adding effects to give their guitar playing more depth. These early effects were quite primitive in terms of engineering, most were created using vacuum tubes and as such, were very bulky and expensive. After transistors became more commercially accessible, creation of more complex and affordable pedal began.




Since then, the popularity has only increased and the number of available guitar effects pedals has sky-rocketed. These effects pedals usually have one effect per pedal, so to stack effects, multiple pedals are required. Using a micro-controller, creating an effects pedal that combines multiple effects into one could be possible, and the potential to be even more affordable than current pedals on the market.




As a result, a user-friendly, low cost pedal would potentially be highly desirable. Using the STM32F7G-DISCOâ€™s inbuilt GLCD display this requirement should be rather trivial to meet. As-well as this, if we port this to a cheaper, and possibly smaller board with DSP capabilities, an effects pedal could then be produced at a rather low cost.
